The project presented here is a personal portfolio website designed and developed using fundamental front-end web development technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (if needed later for interactions). This portfolio website acts as a digital identity for the developer, Priya Shakya, showcasing her skills, projects, and contact details in a clean, structured, and responsive single-page format. In today’s competitive digital world, having a personal online presence is essential, especially for professionals in creative and technical fields like web development. This portfolio is crafted with a minimal yet modern design approach, focusing on readability, responsiveness, and accessibility.
The portfolio consists of multiple clearly defined sections that help users navigate through the content smoothly. The key sections of this portfolio include Home, About, Projects, and Contact. The navigation bar (navbar) is implemented using HTML semantic elements and styled with CSS Flexbox, which ensures that the navigation links are properly aligned and spaced, providing an intuitive experience for the user. The navbar remains sticky at the top while scrolling the page, improving usability and quick access to different sections of the page.
The Home section introduces the developer with a welcoming heading and a brief description stating Priya Shakya as a passionate web developer. This section uses a beautiful gradient background made using CSS linear-gradient, providing an attractive visual appeal and establishing a vibrant theme for the website. The typography is handled using the Segoe UI font family, offering clean and modern text rendering across all devices.
The About section describes Priya's professional interests and technical capabilities. It highlights her passion for front-end development and expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The section content is center-aligned with a maximum width for optimal readability on large screens, and it adapts seamlessly to smaller screens through responsive design principles implemented via CSS media queries.
The Projects section showcases sample projects undertaken by Priya. This includes an Interactive Quiz App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering real-time feedback and scoring, and a Responsive Portfolio Website itself, which demonstrates mobile-first design principles. Each project is presented inside a project card — a styled div with padding, border radius, and subtle shadows, giving a card-like look that improves content separation and readability.

The Contact section provides essential communication details, including an email address and a phone number, enabling visitors or potential employers to reach out directly. All these sections are structured semantically using <section> tags for improved accessibility and SEO benefits.

The footer of the page reinforces Priya Shakya’s personal brand by including a copyright notice.

On the styling side, CSS Flexbox is used to create flexible and adaptive layouts. The CSS file handles everything from spacing, typography, coloring, background gradients, border styling, and responsive behavior. A media query ensures that the site remains user-friendly on mobile devices, adjusting font sizes, spacing, and layout arrangements for screens under 600px width.

The tools and technologies used for this project are:

HTML5 for structuring the web page content.
CSS3 for styling, including Flexbox for layout and Media Queries for responsiveness.
Text Editor (like VS Code) for coding.
Modern web browsers (like Chrome, Edge) for testing and debugging the website.
(Optional future enhancements could include JavaScript for adding interactivity like animations, form validation, or dark mode toggles.)

This application is applicable for:
Personal branding websites for developers, designers, freelancers, and job seekers.
A resume website alternative for showcasing projects, skills, and contact information.
Academic submissions for web development coursework or portfolio projects.
Freelance profile pages for displaying work samples and availability.
As a template base for clients’ portfolio websites in freelance web development projects.
